Hi,

I'm starting this as my personal _non technical_ blog today, I also write <a target="_blank" href="http://codeinventory.com">CodeInventory.com</a> but its pure technical blog, so its best time  on 1st Jan 2017 occasion of new year to start new resolution! :)

I have lot of things which i think and forgot, they comes like lightning bolts and vanishes like same ;)  I think things deeper than space so its very important to keepnote of it and i found this as best place to share and record thoughts.

Wish you a great 2017 ahead, Happy new year!!


*Best,*
